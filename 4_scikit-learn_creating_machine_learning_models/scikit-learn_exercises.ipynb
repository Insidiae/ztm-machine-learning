    "* [**Cross-validation**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/cross_validation.html) - Splits your dataset into multiple parts and train and tests your model on each part and evaluates performance as an average. \n",
    "* [**Precision**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.precision_score.html#sklearn.metrics.precision_score) - Proportion of true positives over total number of samples. Higher precision leads to less false positives.\n",
    "* [**Recall**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.recall_score.html#sklearn.metrics.recall_score) - Proportion of true positives over total number of true positives and false positives. Higher recall leads to less false negatives.\n",
    "* [**F1 score**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.f1_score.html#sklearn.metrics.f1_score) - Combines precision and recall into one metric. 1 is best, 0 is worst.\n",
    "* [**Classification report**](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.classification_report.html) - Sklearn has a built-in function called `classification_report()` which returns some of the main classification metrics such as precision, recall and f1-score.\n",

    "Since we've fitted some models but only compared them via the default metric contained in the `score()` method (R^2 score or coefficient of determination), let's take the `RidgeRegression` model and evaluate it with a few other [regression metrics](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/model_evaluation.html#regression-metrics).\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, let's find:\n",
    "1. **R^2 (pronounced r-squared) or coefficient of determination** - Compares your models predictions to the mean of the targets. Values can range from negative infinity (a very poor model) to 1. For example, if all your model does is predict the mean of the targets, its R^2 value would be 0. And if your model perfectly predicts a range of numbers it's R^2 value would be 1. \n",
    "2. **Mean absolute error (MAE)** - The average of the absolute differences between predictions and actual values. It gives you an idea of how wrong your predictions were.\n",
    "3. **Mean squared error (MSE)** - The average squared differences between predictions and actual values. Squaring the errors removes negative errors. It also amplifies outliers (samples which have larger errors).\n",
